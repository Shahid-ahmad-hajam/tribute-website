          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            Born on 15th October 1931 at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, Dr. Avul
            Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, specialized in Aeronautical
            Engineering from Madras Institute of Technology. Dr. Kalam made
            significant contribution as Project Director to develop India's
            first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which
            successfully injected the Rohini satellite in the near earth orbit
            in July 1980 and made India an exclusive member of Space Club. He
            was responsible for the evolution of ISRO's launch vehicle
            programme, particularly the PSLV configuration. After working for
            two decades in ISRO and mastering launch vehicle technologies, Dr.
            Kalam took up the responsibility of developing Indigenous Guided
            Missiles at Defence Research and Development Organisation as the
            Chief Executive of Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme
            (IGMDP). He was responsible for the development and
            operationalisation of AGNI and PRITHVI Missiles and for building
            indigenous capability in critical technologies through networking of
            multiple institutions. He was the Scientific Adviser to Defence
            Minister and Secretary, Department of Defence Research &amp;
            Development from July 1992 to December 1999. During this period he
            led to the weaponisation of strategic missile systems and the
            Pokhran-II nuclear tests in collaboration with Department of Atomic
            Energy, which made India a nuclear weapon State. He also gave thrust
            to self-reliance in defence systems by progressing multiple
            development tasks and mission projects such as Light Combat
            Aircraft.
